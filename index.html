	<h1>Jacek Piłka, M.Eng.</h1>
	<h3>I am an applied physicist specializing in experimental nonlinear optics of nematic liquid crystals. My PhD research is mainly concerned with vortex beams, methods of their generation and interaction in the nonlinear regime. I am also interested in the automation of physical experiments. In addition to using this knowledge in my own research, I also try to pass it on to students by teaching design courses and supervising bachelor and master theses.
		
I also play the role of IT specialist in my research group, managing the network, computers and my nemesis - the printers. I am always eager to introduce my colleagues to new software and ideas that will help us in our work.

It is hard to find a non-programming experimentalist these days, and I am no exception. I often use Matlab and LabVIEW for my work, but I also enjoy working on side projects that require completely different tools. They range from data analysis, to a library management system, to an Android app for RPG game masters, to an indoor localization system based on Bluetooth transmitters, just to name a few. So I'm no stranger to languages like Python, R, Java, C and C++.

After work, I turn from a physicist into a history buff, especially studying the first civilizations. Or into a machanic when working on my bike.</h3>
